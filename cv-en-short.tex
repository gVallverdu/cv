\cvevent{Data Engineer}{Devoteam/Ysance}{2021 -- Ongoing}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{L'Oréal} As part of one of the IT/BI teams within the R\&D deparment, I participated in a project whose aim was to migrate the existing data pipelines from a Talend/Hadoop environement towards an Airflow/GCP solution.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Data Engineer/Scientist and instructor}{Lincoln/Alten}{2019 -- 2020}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Malakoff Humanis} As part of the team in charge of the data infrastructure, I developed a series of scipts aimed at analyzing the data required for the successful migration of the company's machine learning projects developed on Dataiku DSS. These models relied on data hosted on-premise which was to be moved to the AWS cloud. 
\item \textbf{Orange} I integrated the General Public Marketing team in order to migrate the existing SAS datamarts to Dataiku DSS. I also provided several teams with training for this new tool. 
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Data Engineer/Analyst}{Altran}{2018 -- 2019}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Essilor} As a member of the team tasked with implementing and maintaining the software used internally for optical calculations, I participated in the push towards the creation of a data infrastructure on the cloud AWS. The aim was to be able to exploit the data by making it available to the data science and R\&D teams. I also contributed to the team by automating the analysis of regression tests by developing a series of pyhon scripts which accelerated the team's ability to respond to software bugs.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Research Engineer}{CEA}{2016 -- 2018}{Saclay, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item Refactoring and modularisation of an electrochemistry simulation program used to carry out Molecular Dynamics simulations of \textit{supercapacitors} at constant potential.
\item Implemented a new method for solving electrostatic equations, which was then made available as a stand-alone library.  
\end{itemize}

\cvsection[sidebar-en-1]{Professional experience -- cont.}

\cvevent{Postdoctoral researcher}{UPMC}{2014 -- 2016}{Paris, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed models to study correlated motion in
battery components.
\item Established procedures to generate/analyse large
quantities of data used to explain materials'
properties. 
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry}{Trinity College Dublin}{2009 -- 2013}{Dublin, Ireland}
Computer modelling of metal oxides
\smallskip
\begin{itemize}
\item Carried out molecular simulations of materials for energy production and storage
\item Used theoretical predictions to dispell
misconceptions regarding the roles of impurities
and morphology as possible enhancers of
desired qualities in materials used to generate
energy.
\item Used Fortran/MPI to write simulation and data analysis programs
\end{itemize}

%% sidebar a bit so that it looks aligned with the top of the
%% main column.
