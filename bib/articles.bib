	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by food products are decisive for the perception of aroma and taste. The analysis of gaseous matrices is traditionally done by detection and quantification of few dozens of characteristic markers. Emerging direct injection mass spectrometry technologies offer rapid analysis based on a soft ionisation of VOCs without previous separation. The recent increase of selectivity offered by the use of several precursor ions coupled with untargeted analysis increases the potential power of these instruments. However, the analysis of complex gaseous matrix results in a large number of ion conflicts, making the quantification of markers difficult, and in a large volume of data. In this work, we present the exploitation of untargeted SIFT-MS volatile fingerprints of ewe PDO cheeses in a real farm model, using mixOmics methods allowing us to illustrate the typicality, the manufacturing processes reproducibility and the impact of the animals' diet on the final product.},

The structure and the morphology have been characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. We studied the surface reactivity of these materials by combining X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), gaseous adsorption and first-principle calculations. An evolution of the reactivity toward the SO2 acid gaseous probe has been observed for the three materials, from pure redox mechanism toward mixed acid-base/redox mechanisms, respectively for 5\% and 50\% of stacking faults. We demonstrated that the electronic structure of Li2MnO3 being not modified by stacking faulted. Thus, the surface reactivity of faulted Li2MnO3 is not linked to the SF rate but only governed by the accessible crystalline surfaces and the manganese environments at the surface atomic layer. The formation of (001)-Li surface according to the Li-overstoichiometry on the extreme surface and the random particles shape of the more faulted materials are responsible of the reactivity tuning.},

Total body Se levels were influenced by parental Se nutrition in swim-up fry and by direct Se feeding in 11-week fry with higher levels in the Se-supplemented groups compared with the control and the highest levels in the hydroxy-selenomethionine treatment. The Se retention was lower for dietary sodium selenite. Selenomethionine levels increased when Se was provided as hydroxy-selenomethionine. LA-ICP MS maps revealed yolk in swim-up fry and intestine, liver, and kidney in 11-week fed fry as tissues with high Se abundance. In swim-up fry, muscle Se was the highest abundant when parents were fed hydroxy-selenomethionine. In 11-week fed fry, muscle Se abundance was higher in the head part of fry fed both Se-supplemented diets, but only in the tail part of fry fed hydroxy-selenomethionine. Liver Se abundance was higher in fry fed sodium selenite compared with the control diet supporting the hypothesis that tissue Se distribution can be influenced by parental and dietary Se forms and levels.},

The surface reactivity and the chemical properties of the surface are key factors in the charge-storage mechanism, and β(III)-CoOOH presents interesting characteristics to be used as pseudo-capacitive electrode materials in supercapacitors thanks to its large surface specific area (∼100 m2/gs) and its high electronic conductivity (10–3 to 1 S cm–1). The surface reactivity (basic and redox character) of the synthesized compounds, which consists in aggregates of particles with 60–100 nm length, has been explored from the adsorption of SO2 molecules followed by XPS analyses. A kinetic study of the reactivity allowed us to identify three steps in the adsorption mechanism of our β(III)-CoOOH samples. The coupling of XPS and computational results allows us to establish a link between the surface reactivity in the identified domains, the formation of sulfate and sulfite species, and the cobalt Co3+ and Co4+ species of the active sites along with the underlying electronic processes.},

These limitations can bypass, thanks to the introduction of the notions of angular defect and discrete Gauss curvature coming from discrete differential geometry. In particular, these quantities can be easily computed for arbitrary molecules, trivalent or not, with bond of equal lengths or not. All these quantities have been implemented. We then compute all these quantities over the Tománek database covering an almost exhaustive list of fullerene molecules. In particular, we discuss the interdependence of the pyramidalization angle with the spherical curvature, angular defect, and hybridization numbers. We also explore the dependence of the pyramidalization angle with respect to some characteristics of the molecule, such as the number of atoms, the group of symmetry, and the geometrical optimization process.},

Asphaltene molecules, that compose the largest part of this fraction, can be separated into two subfractions, A1 and A2, through a treatment with p-nitrophenol. In this paper, starting from the molecule models suggested by Acevedo et al. (Acevedo et al. Energy Fuels 2018, 32, 6669−6677.), we screened the chemical structure and composition of the two subfractions and investigated their aggregation mechanism using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that oxygen atoms, present as hydroxyl or carboxylic groups, are a key factor in the formation of large aggregate. From the analysis of the simulations, we estimated the size of the aggregates and showed how the flexibility of the molecules may affect the size of the aggregates. Finally we showed that in addition to the structural differences (such as the H/C ratio and DBE) that distinguish the A1 and A2 subfractions, the solubility of the subfractions is also strongly dependent on the ability of the molecules to bind through hydrogen bonds.},

	abstract = {Breaking water-in-oil emulsions during the refining of crude oils is an important step before any upgrading process is started. Asphaltene molecules are incriminated as playing an important role in this phenomenon. Unraveling the mechanisms behind the affinity between them and water is a key step to understand how to break these emulsions more easily and require lower amounts of demulsifiers. Choosing which demulsifier molecule(s) to use is also primordial, but to do so rationally, one needs to know which are the molecular interactions in place between asphaltenes, porphyrins and water so that demulsifiers are chosen to destabilize a specific physical–chemical interaction. In this paper, we study the interactions arising between asphaltenes and porphyrins and six different molecules potentially displaying a demulsification action in the presence of water/oil interfaces. We demonstrate that the ionic demulsifier molecules present an interesting potential to either interact strongly with water, replacing asphaltenes in this interaction, or to interact with the active sites of asphaltenes, deactivating them and avoiding any asphaltenic interfacial activity. Finally, we also found that although asphaltenes do not migrate spontaneously toward the water/oil interfaces, porphyrins do so rather easily. This indicates that porphyrins do have an important activity at the water/oil interface.},

Ag+ can partially move some porphyrins from the high-molecular-weight (HMW) region to the low-molecular-weight (LMW) region. It was inferred that the interaction between Ag+ and the porphyrins surroundings led to a decrease in the size of the nanoaggregates (HMW region) and an increase in the “free” V porphyrin compounds (MMW and LMW regions). Asphaltenes from a similar origin, presenting the same vanadium GPC ICP-MS profile, gave different GPC ICP-MS profiles after AgOTf addition, which could be linked to the difference in geochemistry of the samples.},

The nature of asphaltene aggregation (colloidal or supramolecular) and the role of solvents and their mixtures are among the least understood parameters in asphaltene science. This paper addresses molecular dynamic simulations to correlate the aggregation properties of asphaltenes, their molecular structure and the concentration of these solvents. We show that the formation of the nanoaggregate depends, primarily, on the size of the conjugated core and on the eventual presence of polar groups capable of forming H-bonds. Heteroatoms on the conjugated core do not change their shape or type of aggregation but may induce stronger π−ππ−π{\textbackslash}uppi - {\textbackslash}uppi interactions. The macroaggregation formation depends upon the length of the lateral chains of asphaltenes and also on the presence of polar groups at its end. Moreover, n-heptane and water may interact selectively with asphaltenes in function of their molecular architecture. Given this fact and the aggregation behavior observed, we advocate toward the assumption that a colloidal behavior of asphaltenes might be a particular case of a more general model, based on a supramolecular description.},

	abstract = {The presence of metalloporphyrins alongside asphaltenes in heavy fractions of crude oil is a key issue in petroleum exploration and upgrading. These compounds are also expected to display interfacial activity in water/toluene mixtures, but the origin of this phenomenon remains uncertain. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate complex asphaltene mixtures constituted of 10 different molecules, under also multifaceted solvation conditions (toluene/n-heptane/water). We add nickel and vanadium (under the form of vanadyl) porphyrins with occasionally grafted polar lateral chains, in these mixtures. The aggregation behavior and interaction with water molecules (as a model to have insights from the interfacial activity of such molecules) are intimately linked to the type of porphyrin and to the molecular properties of the asphaltenes (mainly the presence of polar lateral chains). Vanadium porphyrins, even without polar lateral chains, can form H-bonds that might contribute to their presence within asphaltene nanoaggregates. Moreover, when polar lateral chains are present in asphaltene molecules, the systems display a supramolecular organization with several distinct interactions at the same time. The shapes of these systems do not totally agree with the traditional Yen–Mullins model. In the first part of this work, we finally propose that complex asphaltene systems in complex solvent mixtures seem to have a supramolecular behavior with non-negligent colloidal behavior as well. This should be indicative that Yen–Mullins and Gray’s models of asphaltene self-assembly are neither conflictual nor antagonistic. They are two facets of a scale- and molecular structure-dependent complex mechanism.},

	abstract = {This article deals with the surface reactivity of (001)-oriented Li2MnO3 crystals investigated from a multitechnique approach combining material synthesis, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Li2MnO3 is considered as a model compound suitable to go further in the understanding of the role of tetravalent manganese atoms in the surface reactivity of layered lithium oxides. The knowledge of the surface properties of such materials is essential to understand the mechanisms involved in parasitic phenomena responsible for early aging or poor storage performances of lithium-ion batteries. The surface reactivity was probed through the adsorption of SO2 gas molecules on large Li2MnO3 crystals to be able to focus the XPS beam on the top of the (001) surface. A chemical mapping and XPS characterization of the material before and after SO2 adsorption show in particular that the adsorption is homogeneous at the micro- and nanoscale and involves Mn reduction, whereas first-principles calculations on a slab model of the surface allow us to conclude that the most energetically favorable species formed is a sulfate with charge transfer implying reduction of Mn.},

LiMn2O4 compounds are good candidates as positive electrode of high-power lithium-ion batteries for portable devices. The samples were investigated using both experimental and theoretical approaches. On the experimental point of view, they were characterized in depth from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Then, the reactivity was investigated through the adsorption of (SO2) gaseous probes, in controlled conditions, followed by XPS characterization. First-principle calculations were conducted simultaneously to investigate the electronic properties and the reactivity of relevant surfaces of an ideal LiMn2O4 material. The results allow us to conclude that the reactivity of the samples is dominated by an acido-basic reactivity and the formation of sulfite species. Nonetheless, on the x = 0.05 sample, both sulfite and sulfate species are obtained, the later, in lesser extent, corresponding to a redox reactivity. Combining experimental and theoretical results, this redox reactivity could be associated with the presence of a larger quantity of Mn4+ cations on the last surface layers of the material linked to a specific surface orientation.},

These phases have a high tendency to aggregate, mainly as a result of the presence of asphaltenes, the composition of which has been fairly unclear up to now. The chemical composition of this phase is one of the driving forces behind the physical–chemical behavior in oil, and the structure–property relations of these systems are key in the development of improved refining techniques, including the design of new catalysts. In this paper, the aggregation of asphaltene molecules is studied with regard to molecular architecture and variations in the size of the aromatic core and lateral chain length using classical molecular dynamics simulations. How these characteristics are impacted by the temperature and pressure is also examined. This analysis provides a general overview of the factors that have the strongest impact on the formation and stability of nanoaggregates and clusters of nanoaggregates.},

Nevertheless surface reactivity of this material is still not well known.

For each compound, after a brief description of the bare slab electronic properties, we explored the acido-basic and redox properties of the (110) and (104) surfaces by considering the adsorption of a gaseous probe. The chemisorption of SO2 produces both sulfite or sulfate species associated respectively to an acido-basic or a reduction process. These processes are localized on the transition metals of the first two layers of the surface. Although sulfate species are globally favored, a different behavior is obtained depending on both the surface and the transition metal considered. We conclude with a simple scheme which describes the reduction processes on the both surfaces in terms of formal oxidation degrees of transition metals.},

The present study, based on a confrontation between experiment and theory, aims at providing new knowledge regarding the ionic conductivity model of such systems in correlation with its structure. The computational strategy involved molecular dynamic simulations and first-principle calculations on molecular and periodic models. The experimental target data involve electronic and vibrational properties and were considered through the simulation of Raman and X-ray photoemission spectra in order to identify characteristic patterns of LixPOyNz. In particular, the presence of short phosphate chains is suggested by molecular dynamics calculations, and the simulation of Raman spectra clearly evidenced a new coordination for nitrogen atoms in the amorphous state, not considered until now in the experimental structural model of the electrolyte and initially hypothesized based on core level binding energy computations. Monovalent nitrogen atoms together with short phosphate chains were used to build a structural model of the electrolyte and appeared to lead to a better reproduction of the target experimental results, while it implies a necessary refinement of the diffusion schemes commonly considered for lithium ions.},

The starting hypothesis is that the quenching of fluorescence is related to the internal motion of the chromophore, usually called ‘ φ torsion’. In fact, that motion is hindered by the protein and cannot be studied by standard molecular dynamics. Therefore we have developed a different approach involving three steps.

First the potential of mean force {(PMF)} along the considered torsion is obtained by biased molecular dynamics (umbrella sampling). Then, a long time scale, single particle Brownian dynamics is performed using that {PMF} and an appropriate diffusion constant. Finally we determine the nth passage time {(NPT)} distribution functions at geometries or regions where nonradiative ground state recovery may occur. The {NPT} distributions generalize the more usual ’mean first passage time’ and allow determining different quantities like fluorescence decay profiles, mean fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield etc.

These quantities are used here in a qualitative discussion of the fluorescence decay in Green Fluorescent Protein.},

Then, an analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks shows strong differences between the two conformations in the surroundings of the nitrogen atom of the indolic part of the chromophore. This is partly due to the imperfection in the ? barrel near the His148 residue, which allows the access of one solvent molecule inside the protein in conformation A?. Finally, quantum mechanical calculations of the electronic transition energies of the chromophore in the charge cloud of the protein and solvent water molecules were performed using the {TDDFT} method on 160 snapshots extracted every 5 ps of the {MD} trajectories. It is found that conformations A? and B? exhibit very similar spectra despite different H-bond networks involving the chromophore. This similarity is related to the weak charge transfer involved in the electronic transition and the weak electrostatic field created by {ECFP} near the chromophore, within the hypotheses made in the present simulation.
The dynamics and electronic absorption spectrum of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein {(ECFP)}, a mutant of green fluorescent protein {(GFP)}, have been studied by means of a 1 ns molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulation. The two X-ray conformations A? and B? of {ECFP} were considered.
